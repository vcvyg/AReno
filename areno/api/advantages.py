"""Generalized advantage estimation used by the PPO trainer.

PPO needs per-token advantages `A_t = sum_{l>=0} (gamma*lam)^l delta_{t+l}`
where `delta_t = r_t + gamma * V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)`. The fused `cugae` kernel
is preferred when available; the Python implementation below mirrors the same
math sequence-by-sequence and is used as a portable fallback for tests and
