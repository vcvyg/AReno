"""PPO role declarations used by the trainer/backend boundary.

Algorithms like PPO need several model instances at once (actor/ref/reward/
critic). The trainer names these roles and supplies checkpoint paths; the
backend is responsible for actually loading them, deciding how to colocate or
offload weights, and exposing the score/train operations. Keeping the role
description as a small dataclass keeps the contract minimal.
