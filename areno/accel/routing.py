"""Fused MoE expert-alignment kernel used by the fused MoE forward path.

Given a flattened ``(tokens, top_k)`` matrix of expert ids, ``areno_moe_align``
produces the indirection arrays needed by the block-wise expert MLP kernel:
``sorted_token_ids`` orders tokens by destination expert (and optionally pads
each expert block up to ``block_size``), ``expert_ids`` records the expert
served by each output block, and ``num_tokens_post_pad`` reports the padded
total length so launch parameters can be sized correctly. The kernel writes
into caller-allocated buffers in place; ``cumsum_buffer`` provides scratch
space for the prefix-sum step and must be supplied.
