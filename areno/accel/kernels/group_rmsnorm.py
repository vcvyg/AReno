"""Fused group RMSNorm + SiLU/Swish-gate kernel.

This file implements ``y = (x / rms(x)) * w * sigmoid(gate)`` in a single
Triton kernel. The input is laid out as a 3D tensor of shape ``(M, G, N)``
where ``M`` rows of ``G`` groups each carry an ``N``-wide feature vector that
is independently RMS-normalised. Per-row, per-group reciprocal standard
deviations (``rstd``) are cached and returned so a matching backward kernel
can reuse them without recomputing the reduction.

# both the GPU and N, which is fixed per autotune cache entry.
