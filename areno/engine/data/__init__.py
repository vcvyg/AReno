"""Data containers and helpers shared across engine, runtime and serving.

`batch` defines the dataclasses returned to the user (rollouts, train stats,
sampling parameters) plus tree-walking helpers to move them between devices.
Submodules `rollout_state`, `sampling`, and `tokenizer` are imported on demand
by the runtime and worker layers.
